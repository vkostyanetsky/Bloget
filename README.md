This script generates static files for my blogs in [Russian](https://kostyanetsky.ru) and [English](https://kostyanetsky.me). I expect no interest in it since I made it for personal purposes, so there are no instructions on how to use it. However, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me or [open an issue](https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/Bloget/issues/new).
